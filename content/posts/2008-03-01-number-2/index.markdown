What you see in the photo is not an advance remote controller for a Home Cinema device but the toilet control. There are three kind of toilets in this country, the plain European one, the traditional Japanese (mainly a hole in the ground) and the hi-tech version of the European.

The latest has some of this functions:

* A heating system integrated in the seat.
* A shower-like function to clean your thing after the unloading.
* A mechanism that opens the toilet when you enter the room.
* (Optional) A massage function in the shower-like function.
* (Optional) A drying function.
* (Optional) A power deodorant.
* (Optional) Music to cover the "launching" sounds.

Thus, the only thing I miss is the iPod docking connector.

Anyway, the reason why I am writing this is because yesterday I used one of this hi-tech toilets for the first time since I am in Japan and I must say that the experience was wonderful. I tried all the functions: spray, soft, bidet and drier, in combination with the massage and the oscillation and the thing is great. There was no music function but who cares.

Now the question: when will we see this things in Europe?
