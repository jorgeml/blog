During the last three weeks I have attended many presentations. Some of them are full of buzz-words and I want to summarize them in a new definition for _Smart Surroundings_:

> A new innovative high-speed seamless customised semantic context-aware user-centric face/pattern/image/emotion-recognition-capable high-definition multimedia ubiquitous set of applications, and services developed and implemented using state-of-the-art frameworks, middleware, next generation sensors, RFID, Near Field Communications, optical devices and wireless technology.

Is this buzzword-compliant enough?
