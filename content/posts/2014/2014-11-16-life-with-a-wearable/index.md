A week or so ago I bought one of these Android Wear smartwatches that are trendy lately. I went for a squared shaped one as my previous dumb watch was squared too and the price was very reasonable.

On the negative side of things gone are the days when the watch battery would last years, this one would last a couple of days but just to be safe I charge it every night. There is a microusb connector (that's convenient) hidden on the back of the watch via a plastic thing that I bet it's not going to last much.

The functionality at the moment is limited to providing the time, some useful cards (weather, next appointment and so on), and the phone notifications. That's extremely convenient because you don't need to wait for the developer of your favourite application to bring a smartwatch specific version, notifications just work.

Something I find quite satisfying is the fact that the watch vibrates whenever there is an incoming notification. That means that your phone can stay comfortably in your pocket while you just need to look at your wrist to know what happens. Not interested? Swipe it to the right and it's gone. That means that I spend way less time staring at my phone and more time looking at the surroundings.

Considering wearables are a hip and new thing I'm sure there is a lot of good stuff coming in the future.
