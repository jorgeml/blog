In a few minutes I will leave to Rotterdam and tomorrow I will fly to Japan. Currently I am doing a list in my mind of the things I shouldn't forget.

Yesterday we went to a _traditional_ Japanese restaurant in Borne. I must say that the food was delicious. We had a cook cooking just in front of us and the process was quite impressive. I guess that Japanese are more similar in that sense to Spanish people than for Dutch. The lastest just want to have the food as soon as possible, while Spanish cooking takes more time and some people even enjoy it.

I guess that my next post will come from Japan.
