Apart from the background of the flag there are more white things I noticed in
Japan.

First one is the white mask, similar to those that the dentists use, that some
people use in public spaces such as metro, bus and so on.

What are those things for? It is no more no less than a sign of respect for the
healthy ones: they are sick and they don't want to spread their sickness. Useful?
No idea, has anyone in the room the statistics around?

The other white thing are the white squared small cars, a.k.a. "the fridges",
"koelkasten" in Dutch. They are f*cking ugly, a sample will be available some day in my Gallery.

Don't you feel like opening it and grabbing a "Kirin" beer? I do.
