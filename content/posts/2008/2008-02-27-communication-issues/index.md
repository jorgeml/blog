A lot of people warned me beforehand about the level of English spoken in Japan. It is not as bad as in my home country, but still. Ordering food in the restaurant is an adventure and asking a price in a shop can be a challenge.

Anyway, the new generations seems to be more prepared, there is awareness about the problem and Erik sent me the link to the solution proposed in the Japanese TV, combining fitness and language, body and soul in one. Please enjoy.
