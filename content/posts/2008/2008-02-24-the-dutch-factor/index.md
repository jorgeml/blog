We arrived at the station at 17:30 and the panels were showing that trains were scheduled at 16:06 and 16:30. Time travel? No... the Dutch Factor. The Shinkansen, the worldwide famous bullet train was once again delayed, as if it was ruled by the NS, and that could be due to the presence of Dutch travelers.

After some communication attemps we found out that there were some strong winds and the Shinkansen is not supposed to take off, so the trains were _grounded_.

Fortunately, the Japan Railways, JR (a.k.a. Junior) provides a _best-effort_ service and instead of cancelling trains they came with _only_ 3 hours of delay.

Another topic that I wanted to mention today is how civic Japanese people is. Despite the lack of trash cans, which are more difficult to find that a seat in a metro in rush hour, there is not a single paper on the floor. No graffitis, no broken glasses... everything seems new. That's quite impressive.

Linking this to the previous post, I found some more signs in the train that I would like to share with my readers:

First one is an introduction about smoking and the effects of aerodynamics:

Next one is really advanced: acoustic filtering performed by body anatomy parts and sound propagation, in the same sign!!

This one introduces navigation concepts and shows you the route to the next senior and minor:

The last one is perfect for school children: using the backpack they explain the difference between 2D and 3D:
