September is a critical month because usually it's full of exams. I took 3 out of 4 and I passed 2 of them. Not bad but it could be better. It's even surprising considering how bad were most of my exams. Most of the time I have been sitting on the chair studying.

I'm still looking for Irina, my Russian friend, I haven't received news from her in a lot of time. I hope she's alright.

I went to Dani's village for holidays. The weather was cool on the mornings and during night and the house was cold inside, so my little cold got much worse and I had to come back home one day earlier and I didn't go out that weekend. Also the village was kind of boring, just a bar for amusement, so we saw man movies in DVD.

October has arrived and it looks promising. I have all the ESN stuff (meeting, Sevilla travel and working on the website).
