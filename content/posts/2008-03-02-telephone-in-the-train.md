You might think that there is a lot of people sending and receiving phone calls in the metro or the train because Japanese people love their mobiles so much... No.

It was the case some years ago, when the mobile fever started. The situation was so bad that the government passed new laws and calling is forbidden in trains. Even further, the telephone must be set on _manner_ mode (silence or vibrating). Calling or receiving a call is completely forbidden in the metro and in trains you must go to the link between the wagons.

If you seat in the priority seat or stand near it, the telephone must be completely off.

Thus, no *ssholes shouting on the phone, but a calm ride. Isn't it nice?

Then, what do peple with their telephones during the train rides? They send e-mails (SMS is sooo from the past) or watch TV in panoramic format, turning the screen 90ยบ while holding the main body of the telephone as if they were having a videocall. Isn't it cool? Still in Europe we are discussing which standard to use.
