People don't work usually here on Sundays, so we didn't have any company visit on the program. We started the day with a nice buffet breakfast, including some unhealthy but delicious meat stuff.

Later we took the once more delayed Shinkansen to the city of Hiroshima. For those who do not watch "Who wants to be a millionaire", Hiroshima is the first city that suffered the devastating effects of the American atomic bomb during World War II. A few minutes later Nagasaki was also bombed and Japan signed the capitulations. For more information, please refer to Google, Wikipedia or National Geographic.

Some trivia: we passed across Kobe but we couldn't see anything from the train. Kobe was severely damaged some years ago due to an earthquake. Just after suffering some turbulence in the Shinkansen we arrived to the city and then we took a tram which was the only mean of transportation that we have seen so far that doesn't use the iCoca chip-card.

The first stop in our visit was the A-Dome, which is the only building of the old city that remains in the place. A broken structure supports some burned bricks and the skeleton of a dome.Â  The contrast with the new buildings is quite impressive. The building has declared World Heritage by the UNESCO.

There are some more monuments around that preserve the memory of the victims, we took a look around and take hundreds of pictures, as usual.

Later we walked around the city. There are some crowded streets around full of shops, including the most famous Spanish one: Zara. Erik, Jorrit, Roel and I went to the _Mac Store_ to eat something and afterwards we did some window-shopping.

We found a six stories arcade where we found many games: from slot machines to the newest stuff, but also classic games such as Mario Kart, in which I won the competition. We spent some time and money there. Message to my parents: could you send some of the latest here? Thanks in advance.

Then came a visit to Starbucks, as usual and the discovery of the closest thing to paradise on Earth, a seven stories shop with all sort of electronic gadgets. Unfortunately time was running fast and we couldn't stay much.

For dinner we went to a building where we spread in two or three stories. There  we ate "Okonomiyaki", some kind of Hiroshima typical pancakes / crepes with a lot of different stuff on them.

After dinner we went outside and we met "_Mr. J_", a DJ who was driving a white big Mercedes. The came some fuelling once again in Starbucks we went back to the station, where we met a group of three Geishas and for the first time during the trip the Shinkansen was not delayed.
