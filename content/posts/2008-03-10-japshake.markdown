I have tried sushi, sake, karaoke, teriyaki and all the well-known Japanese stuff. I was still missing something, but I couldn’t do anything to arrange it. When I thought that I was coming back to Nederland, it came: my first earthquake.

Indeed it is not the first one. Ten years ago I was in the States and there was an earthquake during the night. I couldn’t notice. Indeed I’m a deep sleeper so the room could be on fire and I wouldn’t notice.

A year ago there was another one in Madrid, but it was during the holidays and I also didn’t notice. Not the kind of thing that you expect in Madrid, anyway.

But since I arrived to Japan I have been wishing for one. A small one, of course, not like the one in Kobe that devastated the city and killed many people. I wanted a nice and friendly one.

So I thought that it was Jorrit moving the bed, but not, it was a real earthquake. A nice and friendly JapShake.
