Although I don't like politics and I don't want this web to get involved in them, this time I'll write about the American elections. As many of my friends, I support John Kerry for November elections because I really hate George W. Bush.

George W. Bush started the war in Iraq in search for the lost ark of WMD and involved my country in that one. WMD were never found and the country is living a chaotic and insecure situation. Even worse than under the dictatorship.

That's a consequence of a international policy of unilateralism that meant the divorce of the USA with Europe (specially France and Germany).

Another big problem I see is the lack of privacy protection in this war against terror. Civil liberties are cut down in the name of security, both for Americans and foreigners. Security is a trade off and I think that the price paid is too high (wiretapping phones and the internet, CAPS security in airport), everything under the "great" name of "Patriot Act".

Also many artist (Pearl Jam, REM, Bruce Springsteen) have been participating lately in the "Vote for change" tour, to tell Americans that a change is needed.

I don't know how many Americans read this thing, but I just want to tell you that if we want a better world, George W. Bush shouldn't stay longer at the White House.
