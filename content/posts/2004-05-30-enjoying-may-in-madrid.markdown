As we say in Spanish, "nothing new under the sun". We have sun, a lot. But also storms. We were still in that period when the weather is changing.

Maybe it was because one of those changes that I got sick and I spent a Monday in bed while my classmates thought that I had a hangover. On Monday.

I am still working on my assignments. Sometimes I wish I was studying an easier major at university so I could have more time for enjoying myself.

Anyway, I had one of those moments of enjoying, in good company. It is amazing how extremely good is walk around the center of Madrid and eat dinner in a calm terrace... in excelent company.

I had to record a video for a friend of mine assignments. It was really fun and we had a great time. Too bad some people did not come.

May was also the day when the royal wedding took place. Since I am republican I went to a car show with a friend. Anyway, I liked Ernest of Hannover's plan, who missed the ceremony because he drank the whole minibar in his hotel and had a terrible hangover. Way to go.

About important guests, by the end of the month I had news from a couple of good friends who may come to Spain this summer. The "Finish-Spanish-Dutch" alliance, on tour, coming soon to the Spanish roads.

The time for assignments is almost over. Time for exams begins. Usually I "disappear" by then, focusing all my attention to my books, papers and so on.

Anyway, I will be punctual to my monthly delivery. Enjoy. Be happy.
