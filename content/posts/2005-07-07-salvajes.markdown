It's difficult to write when things don't make sense. What is happening in the mind of someone who kills hundreds of people that commute to work? How brain-damaged can be someone who kills in the name of a god? How twisted can be a reading of a sacred book? Difficult questions for difficult times.

All I can say and do is giving my all my support to the victims' families, to the city of London and its citizens, and to all human people who believe in a free world in peace.
