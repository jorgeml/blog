Time goes fast around this corner of the world and I wanted to mention some small thingies about our trip to Japan:

* The temperature in Japanes offices is terrible. In most places we have seen the airco working at 25 degrees, and people are working happily while we sweat our suits.
* It is impossible to find a trash can. For whatever reason it takes minutes to find one. Most of the time I keep the stuff myself during the whole day and drop it in the hotel.
* On the other hand WiFi networks are easy to find, even on board of the Shinkansen, but most of them are closed or you have to pay to use them.
* [QR Codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) are 2D bar codes. They are printed everywhere in ads, posters, magazines and so on. The idea is that using the camera of your mobile you can take a picture and your mobile will decode and show the information: an internet address, contact details from a person, etc. The idea is quite cool. The most bizarre place where we have found a QR-Code is in the box of the McDonald's frites. Nevertheless, the macro function of our mobiles' cameras doesn't work that well and so far we had little / none success with QR Codes.
