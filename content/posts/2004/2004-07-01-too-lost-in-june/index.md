June is famous for several reasons. The first one is that summer comes finally, with a huge increase of temperature and sun every single day. As a consequence of that, female clothes shrinks, but that is another story. June is also exams time, this year I also had a lot of lab assignments, most of them with little value but quite time-consuming.

Another important news in this June is that my team played the basketball finals. Although we lost, our players did a good job and we enjoyed the games.

That "miracle" could be explained, as many other incredible things that happened this month, by that Venus transit thing that happened.

Finally holidays came and the most important thing I am doing right now is searching for a job. I have that feeling that I have a too good resumé for most of the jobs I wold apply for.

I also did a market research. A market research is some kind of meeting where a new product is introduced to a group and they have to give their opinion. I went to one about a cream for putting inside sandwiches. We ate for free, drink for free and got paid 30€ for one hour and a half of "work".

One of the most important news is that Aki and Maarten are finally coming, they already booked the flight. That will happen in August. It is going to be like a joke "There is a Finnish, a Dutch and a Spanish going to...".

Enjoy your holidays if you can. Take care.
