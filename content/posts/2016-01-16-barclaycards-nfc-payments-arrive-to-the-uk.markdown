While Google has not rolled out their NFC payment system to the UK ([Android Pay](https://www.android.com/pay/)) it is now possible to do mobile payments with Android thanks to Barclays.

The last release of their [Barclaycard app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.barclays.bca) enables NFC payments with mobiles that have the technology built-in (basically any non-cheap recent [Android](http://www.android.com)).

How does it work then? The initial set-up couldn't be easier as you only need to select the [Barclaycard](https://www.barclaycard.co.uk) application as default payment method in the Android settings and then choose your default credit card. To reduce fraud you'll be asked to enter your PIN every few transactions, every time you reboot your phone and if the amount to pay is larger than £30 (the limit is £100).

The payment process itself it is as easy as placing your phone near the payment terminal. I believe the phone needs to be unlocked for NFC to be active but there is no need to open the app, even the home screen will do. There is also no need to have a cellular or WiFi connection.

Is it worth it? Yes, because getting my phone out of my pocket and unlocking it with my fingerprint it is much quicker than grabbing my wallet, opening it and pulling the card out.

Are there any drawbacks? Well, for starters Barclaycard is not my preferred payment method so that limits a lot my usage. It is also not a huge time-saver over the plastic card. What is really missing is integration with loyalty cards such as the one from my local supermarket because that will make the checkout process much quicker. Unfortunately I'm afraid for that we'll have to wait for Google.
