It feels like it was yesterday when I told Jorrit: "_Hey, it seems that some guys are going to Japan_". In a couple of days we were in an office asking for information. Today we finished all the previous work, after all it is a study trip, and now it is time to pack the stuff and go.

I might say I am quite excited. I have learnt that Japan is a totally different country, the cultural shock is going to be 100 times bigger than when I moved to the Netherlands.

In eight days we will take the airplane to Japan. After several hours of trip we will arrive to the land of the rising sun. Then we will spend three weeks visiting companies: Toyota, Sharp, ~~Nintendo~~, NEC... We will learn what is happening there in the topic of Smart Surroundings. Smart Surroundigs is the technology that will allow our fridge to know that meat is not longer good, ~~we drank all the beer last night~~, and we have a last minute appointment. Our cars will avoid collisions because the road told it that there is an accident ahead. We will know where our children are, if they have fever or not, and they will have a PDA that thell them where their favourite toy is. Sounds good? It is.

From now on I will write here some stuff about my trip. I will do it in English as a courtesy to my groupmates because my Dutch stills sucks (not as much as my Japanese) and they haven't learnt Spanish yet. And everyone in Spain speaks good English, right?

Konnichiwa.
