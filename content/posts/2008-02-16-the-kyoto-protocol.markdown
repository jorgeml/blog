Yesterday we spent the night in a budhist temple. I was expecting something more classic, but instead it was more IKEA-style. If I summarize my experience in one word it would be "cold". The thing was freaking cold. Moreover we had to walk around without shoes and the thing sucks. For the last two days I have barely used shoes!

Anyway, now I understand what all this Kyoto protocol is about: since there is a global warming, let's switch us the heating!
