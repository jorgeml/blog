The bad thing about March is that I had to leave the Netherlands. And the exams. I took 5 courses and I had to do 4 exams. For a Nederlander, that's a lot.

I had to do some paperwork before leaving. Too bad that I forgot to log out in the Enschede municipality and my "Italian successor" (the new guy on my room) had some problems with the paperwork. Sorry.

On my last basketball training I had a sprain in my ankle. That kind of stuff can only happen to me. Then I had to drive to Spain, through Germany ''autobahns''. Thanks Aki for driving for some time. In Germany we saw a huge castle, very beautiful.

So sad that I had to say goodbye to a lot of people. At first I wasn't, I was thinking as if I was to meet them all tomorrow. Every day that passes without them is more sad. I'll meet some of them in the upcoming months.

2.400 km, 24 hours after departing from Enschede I arrived at Madrid. I spent a huge time unpacking, then talking to relatives and friends. When coming back to college, I noticed three kind of people, depending on their answer to my "Good morning":

* _"Good morning"_: Classical example of the guy who didn't care and is not going to care.
* _"Good morning" and strange face, maybe a question_: people who didn't know i was leaving
* _"Good mor... WTF!! What a surprise"_: people who were missing me.

I also spent a huge amount of time with this web page. The installation, configuration and layout was more or less easy, but I spent a lot of time renaming and organizing the pictures.

Now I keep myself busy with some papers and study I have to do. But I still smile when I remember the Netherlands.
