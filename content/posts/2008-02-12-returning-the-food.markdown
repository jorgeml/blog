Lately we have been eating really a lot: sushi, teri-yake and even hamburguers for breakfast. Together with the lack of sleep and the jet-lag, the mix is not really good.

We were in the bus to a company and Ronald, from the organizing committee (OC) suddenly looked like a balloon-fish. He started to puke and half of the bus was covered with his food left-overs. I could escape from the flood literally for centimeters.

Later we were visiting the company research lab. A nice Japanese woman was showing us the terrace while explaining that it was the gathering point for smokers. One of the employees was lightning a cigarette up in the background while our Erik was leaning against the balcony, maybe with the same intentions. No. He started to puke, and the Japanese woman covered his laughing mouth.

Later came Maarten, and my guessing for numbers 4 and 5 is Pascal and Freek.

Soon I will write something about the mouth masks, another Japanese icon. Now we are going to sleep and digest the McDonald's dinner, that hopefully is safe enough.
