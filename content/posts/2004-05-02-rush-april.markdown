This month I'm really busy with university. In the Netherlands I had a lot of assignments, specially the ones about programming, and I could arrange my schedule and do the shopping, the ironing and so on.

Back in Madrid the things are different. Most subjects have a more or less complex lab assignment, with three hours lab session, previous theoric work and afterwards you have to submit a report about what you've seen (or not) in the lab.

Once again I have to take care about my language. This time I was having some troubles with a piece that was supposed to hold an optic fiber in a more or less stable position. It was taking some time to adjust the piece so I said something to it. I didn't realise the professor was standing just behind me. Life sucks, once again.

The good thing about spending twelve hours in university is that time flies away. Although that's bad concerning deadlines, I've noticed that I'm more or less surviving, delivering everything and when I stop for a second weekend has arrived.

Moreover the weather is good. Well, it was good. Right now I look thru the window and it's raining. We had a few sunny days and that's nice for laying in the grass after eating lunch at university.

Probably that's the second best thing in life.
