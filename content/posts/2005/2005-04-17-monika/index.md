The best thing you can do after watching the Taekwondo World Series in the new "Palacio de los Deportes" is walking in the close Retiro Park. The best thing that can happen to you while walking is receiving a phone call from a nice German girl. Actually I was the one that started the thing, with a message to Monika saying happy birthday on her voicemail. It was nice to hear her voice again, this time without tea. A promise: I'll go to the Oktoberfest. In these difficult days, a _simple_ phone call makes me smile. Happiness in little things.
