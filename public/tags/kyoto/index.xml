      <description>Yesterday we spent the night in a budhist temple. I was expecting something more classic, but instead it was more IKEA-style. If I summarize my experience in one word it would be &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo;. The thing was freaking cold. Moreover we had to walk around without shoes and the thing sucks. For the last two days I have barely used shoes!
Anyway, now I understand what all this Kyoto protocol is about: since there is a global warming, let&amp;rsquo;s switch us the heating!</description>
