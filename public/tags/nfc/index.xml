      <description>While Google has not rolled out their NFC payment system to the UK (Android Pay) it is now possible to do mobile payments with Android thanks to Barclays.
The last release of their Barclaycard app enables NFC payments withÂ mobiles that have the technology built-in (basically any non-cheap recent Android).
How does it work then? The initial set-up couldn&amp;rsquo;t be easier as you only need to select the Barclaycard application as default payment method in the Android settings and then choose your default credit card.</description>
