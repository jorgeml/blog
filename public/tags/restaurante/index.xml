      <description>In a few minutes I will leave to Rotterdam and tomorrow I will fly to Japan. Currently I am doing a list in my mind of the things I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t forget.
Yesterday we went to a traditional Japanese restaurant in Borne. I must say that the food was delicious. We had a cook cooking just in front of us and the process was quite impressive. I guess that Japanese are more similar in that sense to Spanish people than for Dutch.</description>
