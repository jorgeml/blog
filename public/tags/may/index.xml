      <description>As we say in Spanish, &amp;ldquo;nothing new under the sun&amp;rdquo;. We have sun, a lot. But also storms. We were still in that period when the weather is changing.
Maybe it was because one of those changes that I got sick and I spent a Monday in bed while my classmates thought that I had a hangover. On Monday.
I am still working on my assignments. Sometimes I wish I was studying an easier major at university so I could have more time for enjoying myself.</description>
