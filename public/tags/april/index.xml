      <description>This month I&amp;rsquo;m really busy with university. In the Netherlands I had a lot of assignments, specially the ones about programming, and I could arrange my schedule and do the shopping, the ironing and so on.
Back in Madrid the things are different. Most subjects have a more or less complex lab assignment, with three hours lab session, previous theoric work and afterwards you have to submit a report about what you&amp;rsquo;ve seen (or not) in the lab.</description>
