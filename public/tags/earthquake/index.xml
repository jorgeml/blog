      <description>I have tried sushi, sake, karaoke, teriyaki and all the well-known Japanese stuff. I was still missing something, but I couldn’t do anything to arrange it. When I thought that I was coming back to Nederland, it came: my first earthquake.
Indeed it is not the first one. Ten years ago I was in the States and there was an earthquake during the night. I couldn’t notice. Indeed I’m a deep sleeper so the room could be on fire and I wouldn’t notice.</description>
