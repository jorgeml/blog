      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe more or less how was my summer holidays. Although summer is not officially over, the exams&amp;rsquo; season is about to start. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share the experiences of what has happened until now.
During the last days of June I was looking for a job that allowed me to have a wealthier economy for the rest of the summer. Unfortunately I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything.
July was quite a regular month, nothing really special excepting my birthday, but not a big deal.</description>
