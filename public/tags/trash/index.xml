      <description>Time goes fast around this corner of the world and I wanted to mention some small thingies about our trip to Japan:
 * The temperature in Japanes offices is terrible. In most places we have seen the airco working at 25 degrees, and people are working happily while we sweat our suits. * It is impossible to find a trash can. For whatever reason it takes minutes to find one.</description>
