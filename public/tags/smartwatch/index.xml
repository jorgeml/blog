      <description>A week or so ago I bought one of these Android Wear smartwatches that are trendy lately. I went for a squared shaped one as my previous dumb watch was squared too and the price was very reasonable.
On the negative side of things gone are the days when the watch battery would last years, this one would last a couple of days but just to be safe I charge it every night.</description>
