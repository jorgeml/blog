      <description>While Google has not rolled out their NFC payment system to the UK (Android Pay) it is now possible to do mobile payments with Android thanks to Barclays.
The last release of their Barclaycard app enables NFC payments withÂ mobiles that have the technology built-in (basically any non-cheap recent Android).
How does it work then? The initial set-up couldn&amp;rsquo;t be easier as you only need to select the Barclaycard application as default payment method in the Android settings and then choose your default credit card.</description>

      <description>A week or so ago I bought one of these Android Wear smartwatches that are trendy lately. I went for a squared shaped one as my previous dumb watch was squared too and the price was very reasonable.
On the negative side of things gone are the days when the watch battery would last years, this one would last a couple of days but just to be safe I charge it every night.</description>
