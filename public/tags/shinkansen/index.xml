      <description>We arrived at the station at 17:30 and the panels were showing that trains were scheduled at 16:06 and 16:30. Time travel? No&amp;hellip; the Dutch Factor. The Shinkansen, the worldwide famous bullet train was once again delayed, as if it was ruled by the NS, and that could be due to the presence of Dutch travelers.
After some communication attemps we found out that there were some strong winds and the Shinkansen is not supposed to take off, so the trains were grounded.</description>
