      <description>It feels like it was yesterday when I told Jorrit: &amp;ldquo;Hey, it seems that some guys are going to Japan&amp;rdquo;. In a couple of days we were in an office asking for information. Today we finished all the previous work, after all it is a study trip, and now it is time to pack the stuff and go.
I might say I am quite excited. I have learnt that Japan is a totally different country, the cultural shock is going to be 100 times bigger than when I moved to the Netherlands.</description>
