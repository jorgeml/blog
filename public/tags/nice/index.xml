      <description>There are two things that so far have impressed me a lot. First of all, I really can&amp;rsquo;t understand the signs, excepting those for the toilets.
Second impression: Japanese people are really nice. Two examples: the cabin crew in the airplane was telling me &amp;ldquo;Sorry for the delay in bringing the food&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Thank you very much, we are proud of having you here&amp;rdquo; and so on. We went to a restaurant for dinner and even if we were supposed to use the touch-screen automated waiter service a waiter came to us to try to explain the menu in her poor English.</description>
