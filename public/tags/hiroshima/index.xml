      <description>People don&amp;rsquo;t work usually here on Sundays, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any company visit on the program. We started the day with a nice buffet breakfast, including some unhealthy but delicious meat stuff.
Later we took the once more delayed Shinkansen to the city of Hiroshima. For those who do not watch &amp;ldquo;Who wants to be a millionaire&amp;rdquo;, Hiroshima is the first city that suffered the devastating effects of the American atomic bomb during World War II.</description>
